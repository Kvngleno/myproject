            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Eiffel Tower, named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, is a wrought-iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It was constructed between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair, held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.</p>

            <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The Eiffel Tower was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design. However, it quickly became a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930.</p>

            <h2>Architectural Details</h2>
            <p>Standing 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. The tower is made of iron and weighs approximately 10,000 tonnes. It is painted every seven years to protect it from rust, a task that requires around 60 tonnes of paint.</p>

            <h2>Modern Use</h2>
            <p>Today, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year. It also serves as a broadcast tower and has been equipped with various antennas over the years to accommodate this function.</p>
